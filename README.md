# Project Color

Automatically affect a window color for each project (workspace).

The color will be stored and editable in `.vscode/color.json`.
Sadly, the `.vscode/settings.json` file will be updated automatically while changing the color because vscode doesn't allow to change settings "on the fly".

I recommend that you enable this extension only on a workspace basis, to avoid having unwanted colors and files appear on projects.

## Installation

To install, please load manually the last `.vsix` file from `releases/`.
There is no plan to put this extension to the marketplace for now.
